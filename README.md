### User Configuration
Create `config/user.conf` to customize behavior:

```batch
set "CONFIG_THEME=dark"
set "CONFIG_VERBOSE=true"
set "CONFIG_AUTO_UPDATE=true"
set "CONFIG_TELEMETRY=false"
```

### Logging Configuration
- Logs are automatically created in `logs/` directory
- Log files include timestamps and detailed operation tracking
- Log retention can be configured in the main script

## 🔒 Security & Safety

### Administrative Privileges

- UAC elevation is handled automatically and securely
- All operations are logged for audit purposes

### Data Protection
- Registry backups are created before modifications
- System restore points are created during major changes
- All operations can be safely reversed

### Safe Operations
- Read-only operations are clearly marked
- Destructive operations require confirmation
- All changes are logged with rollback information

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"Access Denied" Errors**
- Ensure the script is run as administrator
- Check that UAC is not blocking the elevation request
- Verify Windows security policies allow script execution

**PowerShell Execution Policy**
- Run: `Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser`
- Or use: `powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File script.ps1`

**Missing Features on Older Windows**
- Some features require Windows 10/11
- Legacy support is provided where possible
- Check logs for compatibility warnings
